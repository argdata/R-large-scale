# Large-scale data analysis in R

November 13 & 14, 2017
Research Computing Center Workshop
University of Chicago

The main aim of this workshop is give you a solid footing for
transitioning from *interactive* (exploratory) data analysis in R to
*non-interactive* (automated) large-scale data analysis within a
cluster computing environment (specifically, the RCC's newest and most
powerful cluster, *midway2*). This will involve:

1. Making most effective use of computational resources on the RCC
cluster (managing memory, parallel/multithreaded computing),

2. Using R in combination with the SLURM job engine to run
hundreds of data analyses simultaneously.
